# MOS capacitor calculator

The base notebook can be found [at this link](https://h-gens.github.io/automated-drawing-of-the-mos-band-diagram.html), it has been slightly modified to meet my kwnoledge on semiconductor.
The formulas used here are from the course "Microelectronics" held by professor Enrico Zanoni at University of Padua in the year 2020-2021.

This is an example of a energy band plot result.
